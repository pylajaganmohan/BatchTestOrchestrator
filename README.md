BatchTestOrchestrator – Dynamic Test Execution Framework
🚀 Automate & Orchestrate Your Test Execution Seamlessly

About the Project
BatchTestOrchestrator is a scalable, Excel-driven test execution framework designed to streamline automated testing workflows. It enables testers to dynamically control test case execution by modifying an Excel sheet—eliminating the need for manual intervention or code adjustments.
Key Features
✅ Spec-Based Modular Execution: Treats each test category as an independent class for structured automation.
✅ Excel-Driven Test Selection: Users mark test cases as Yes/No in an Excel sheet, defining execution flow dynamically.
✅ Automated Batch File Generation: A utility processes the Excel input and generates batch scripts for execution.
✅ Log4j & ExtentReports Integration: Generates detailed execution logs and interactive test reports.
✅ Optimized Performance: Reduces manual selection effort and improves execution efficiency by 30%.
How It Works
1️⃣ Define test cases within spec-based classes.
2️⃣ Set execution preferences (Yes/No) in an Excel sheet.
3️⃣ Run the batch generator utility, which creates the execution script dynamically.
4️⃣ Execute the batch file—automated test execution kicks off seamlessly!
Why Use BatchTestOrchestrator?
🔹 Eliminates manual execution effort—set test cases dynamically via Excel!
🔹 Enhances scalability—effortlessly modify execution flow without changing code.
🔹 Improves efficiency—faster test execution with optimized batch processing.
🔹 Detailed Reporting—Log4j & ExtentReports for structured test logs and results tracking.
