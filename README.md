# BatchTestOrchestrator – Dynamic Test Execution Framework 🚀  

## 🔹 Overview  
BatchTestOrchestrator is a **scalable, Excel-driven test execution framework** designed for **automated testing workflows**. It allows testers to **control test execution dynamically** via an **Excel sheet**, eliminating manual intervention while ensuring seamless **batch file automation**.

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Spec-Based Modular Execution:** Treats each test category as a separate class for structured automation.  
✅ **Excel-Driven Test Selection:** Users define execution preferences (`Yes/No`) dynamically within an Excel sheet.  
✅ **Automated Batch File Generation:** A utility dynamically creates execution scripts based on selected specs.  
✅ **Log4j & ExtentReports Integration:** Generates detailed execution logs and interactive test reports.  
✅ **Optimized Performance:** Reduces manual selection effort, improving execution efficiency by **30%**.

## 🔧 How It Works  
1️⃣ Define test cases within **spec-based classes**.  
2️⃣ Set execution preferences (`Yes/No`) in an Excel sheet.  
3️⃣ Run the **batch generator utility**, which creates the execution script dynamically.  
4️⃣ Execute the batch file—automated test execution kicks off seamlessly!

## ✨ Why Choose BatchTestOrchestrator?  
🔹 Eliminates manual execution effort—set test cases dynamically via Excel!  
🔹 Enhances scalability—effortlessly modify execution flow without changing code.  
🔹 Improves efficiency—faster test execution with optimized batch processing.  
🔹 Detailed reporting—Log4j & ExtentReports for structured test logs and results tracking.
